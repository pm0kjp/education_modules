**Is this module right for me?** @long_description

**Estimated time to completion:**

**Pre-requisites**

Before you start this module, make sure you have

* Configured Git on your computer. See [this module](https://education.arcus.chop.edu) to learn how.
* The ability to edit .txt documents. Click [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/#create-a-text-file) for an introduction to editing text files using `nano`.

If you would prefer to work through this module on your own computer, you can find a module on Bash 101 [here](link to bash 101 module).

**Learning Objectives**

@learning_objectives

For help articulating learning objectives, see [this guide to learning objectives, including lots of example verbs](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/).

</div>

## Lesson Preparation

Here we include information about a virtual box/command line emulator learners can use to do exercises.

If you prefer to run these examples on your own machine, open a command line interface (CLI).

## Creating a Repository

Once Git is configured,
we can start using it.

We will continue with the story of Wolfman and Dracula who are investigating if it
is possible to send a planetary lander to Mars.

First, let's create a directory in `Desktop` folder for our work and then move into that directory:

~~~
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Then we tell Git to make `planets` a [repository]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#repository)
-- a place where Git can store versions of our files:


~~~
$ git init
~~~
{: .language-bash}

It is important to note that `git init` will create a repository that
includes subdirectories and their files---there is no need to create
separate repositories nested within the `planets` repository, whether
subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later. Also, note
that the creation of the `planets` directory and its initialization as a
repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `planets` called `.git`:

~~~
$ ls -a
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
.	..	.git
~~~
{: .output}

Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project,
including all files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.
If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory,
we will lose the project's history.

Next, we will change the default branch to be called `main`.
This might be the default branch depending on your settings and version
of git.
See the [setup episode](02-setup.md) for more information on this change.

~~~
git checkout -b main
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Switched to a new branch 'main'
~~~
{: .output}


We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

If you are using a different version of `git`, the exact
wording of the output might be slightly different.

> ## Places to Create Git Repositories
>
> Along with tracking information about planets (the project we have already created),
> Dracula would also like to track information about moons.
> Despite Wolfman's concerns, Dracula creates a `moons` project inside his `planets`
> project with the following sequence of commands:
>
> ~~~
> $ cd ~/Desktop   # return to Desktop directory
> $ cd planets     # go into planets directory, which is already a Git repository
> $ ls -a          # ensure the .git subdirectory is still present in the planets directory
> $ mkdir moons    # make a subdirectory planets/moons
> $ cd moons       # go into moons subdirectory
> $ git init       # make the moons subdirectory a Git repository
> $ ls -a          # ensure the .git subdirectory is present indicating we have created a new Git repository
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> Is the `git init` command, run inside the `moons` subdirectory, required for
> tracking files stored in the `moons` subdirectory?
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > No. Dracula does not need to make the `moons` subdirectory a Git repository

> >
> > Additionally, Git repositories can interfere with each other if they are "nested":

> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
> ## Correcting `git init` Mistakes
> Wolfman explains to Dracula how a nested repository is redundant and may cause confusion
> down the road. Dracula would like to remove the nested repository. How can Dracula undo
> his last `git init` in the `moons` subdirectory?
>
> > ## Solution -- USE WITH CAUTION!

> > ### Background
> > Removing files from a Git repository needs to be done with caution. But we have not learned
> > yet how to tell Git to track a particular file; we will learn this in the next episode. Files
> > that are not tracked by Git can easily be removed like any other "ordinary" files with
> > ~~~
> > $ rm filename
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-bash}
> >
> > Similarly a directory can be removed using `rm -r dirname` or `rm -rf dirname`.
> > If the files or folder being removed in this fashion are tracked by Git, then their removal

> > ### Solution
> > Git keeps all of its files in the `.git` directory.

## Module Content

Note that liascript will create a new page at each level 1, 2, or 3 header, so to avoid a page with only a header and no content, include text after each header before the next.

Text after level 2 headers provides a good opportunity to give a sentence or two of overview, explain the structure of the coming content, and/or get preliminaries out of the way.

## Including Media


![A valuable image, and this is its alt text.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Grosser_Panda.JPG "Here is a subtitle that will display beneath the image.")


You can link to images online with their url, or locally with the file path, e.g. `![image caption](media/my_image.png)`

If you want to provide several images in a gallery, just make a "paragraph" of image links and LiaScript will render it as a gallery:

![img1 alt text.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Ailuropoda_melanoleuca_%28Panda_g%C3%A9ant%29_-_445.jpg) ![img2 alt text.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Panda_giganti_al_Giant_Panda_Breeding_Research_Base_Chengdu.jpg) ![img3 alt text.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/BabyPandaAtSDZ.jpg)


!?[This video is hosted on youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIAO4Htzn8M)

You can also embed local videos, just as with images: `!?[An embedded video.](vid/intro.mp4 "This is its subtitle")`

In theory, you should be able to embed just about anything. Read more [here](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaScript/docs/master/README.md#24).

You can also include movies, audio, and any other embedded content in galleries just by putting the links for them all in a paragraph.

## Including highlight boxes

Include special notes with different formatting. The style "important" is for important points and key ideas. For example:

<div class = "important">
Tip: It's generally much easier to make any necessary changes to the dataframe, such as mutating variables, before sending it to the plotting command.
</div>

The style "care" is for content related to compassion, self-care, and motivation. For example:

<div class = "care">
This is a topic with a tremendous amount of jargon, which can make resources you may find online hard to understand for folks new to the field. When that happens it's easy to feel like there's something wrong with you if you don't get it, but that's not the case! Those kinds of gatekeeping explanations are a failure on the part of the writer, not the learner.
</div>


The style "help" is for educational first aid --- "help I'm lost!" suggestions. For example:

<div class = "help">
Feeling overwhelmed? It takes a long time to learn git, so don't be disheartened if it doesn't click initially. Just focus on stage, commit, and push. Ignore the rest for now, until you've had a chance to practice just the stage-commit-push process several times.
</div>

The style "warning" alerts users to potential pitfalls. For example:

<div class = "warning">
A common mistake when using `filter` is to write = when you mean ==. Remember that = is for argument assignment, and == is for testing equality in conditions. If you get them mixed up, your code won't run!
</div>

The style "learnmore" alerts users resources for further learning, especially links to a more in-depth discussion of an issue that might be touched on only briefly in the module.

<div class = "learnmore">
To learn more about the theory behind ggplot2, read [Hadley Wickham's article, "A Layered Grammar of Graphics"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)
</div>

The style "options" is for an aside to let learners know there's another possible approach. For example:

<div class = "options">
You could also skip setting up an OSF account completely and just use github to publish and share your research products, but many people prefer to have OSF links available.
</div>
or
<div class = "options">
To do this in R instead of python, see this other module.
</div>

There's an additional style of highlight, "answer", that is used in [quizzes](#quiz).

## Including math

I want to include a math statement here: $ 1 + \beta = 2 $

## Including code

Next comes some code. This code won't do anything (it's not interactive).

```r
# You only need to install it once
install.packages("ggplot2")

# You'll need to load the library anew for each R session
library("ggplot2")
```
You don't have to specify the programming language, but you can, and it should help you get appropriate syntax highlighting.

```python
print("This is python code")
```

It is possible to include interactive code, too! See [the Rextester template for LiaScript](https://github.com/LiaTemplates/Rextester).

## Quiz

Quizzes are just more markdown text, so if you want it to show up on its own page, put a new header before it. Otherwise you can include quiz questions at the end of a section, or even interspersed with the rest of your content.

Quizzes should connect directly to your learning objectives. Each quiz question should connect to one learning objective, and every learning objective should have at least one quiz question associated with it somewhere in the module.

Here is the first question. It's multiple choice.

[(X)] This answer is right
[( )] This is wrong
[( )] Also wrong
[[?]] Hint: Provide a hint here if you like. Hints are marked with the ?
[[?]] Hint: You can include as many hints as you want.

You can have questions with multiple correct answers. Select all of the following correct choices:

[[ ]] Not this one
[[X]] This is one of the correct ones
[[X]] Here's another correct one
[[ ]] This one is wrong, though
[[?]] Hint: Remember to select ALL of the correct choices.

True or False: This statement is NOT true. ;)

[( )] TRUE
[(X)] FALSE

Short answer/text response. Note that, without any additional script, to get it marked "correct" the learner has to enter it exactly as you do.

[[right answer]]
[[?]] Hint: The answer is "right answer"
***
<div class = "answer">
This is extra text that will show up after the learner clicks to have the correct answer revealed. It can be as long as you like, and allows any markdown formatting (you can embed pictures or videos, links, etc.).

Use `<div class = "answer">` to mark these sections with special styling, so that they're visually distinct from the rest of the quiz. The style for `"answer"` is defined in the css file.

For this context to show up automatically when the learner answers the question correctly or clicks to have the right answer revealed, it needs to be surrounded by `***` (at least three, but you can use more if you want a more visually distinct horizontal marker in your md file).
</div>
***

We can allow some flexibility in what we accept as correct answers for text by adding a little script after the answer, though. For the following, either "right answer" or "correct answer" (not case sensitive) will be accepted:

[[right answer]]
<script>
  let input = "@input".trim().toLowerCase();
  input == "right answer" || input == "correct answer";
</script>
***
<div class = "answer">
For this question, either "right answer" or "correct answer" (not case sensitive) counts as correct.
</div>
***

This question accepts any of several items from a list of possible correct answers. It is not case sensitive (that's the little `i` at the end of the regex).

[[this text will never show up if they type a right answer and click "Check", only if they click the checkmark button to reveal the answer]]
[[?]] Hint: The answers are like "item1", "item2", etc.
<script>
  let input = "@input".trim();
  /item1|item2|item3|item4/i.test(input);
</script>
***
<div class = "answer">
With flexible answers like this, it's definitely a good idea to include a follow-up to help the learner put their answer in context.

For example, if the question was "Name one or more colors" with acceptable answers including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple, and they wrote "red, green, and the center of a black hole" that would be marked as correct because it contains at least one string from the acceptable list. Similarly, "hammered metal" would be marked as correct because it contains the string "red" ([you can prevent this if you want](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regexp_begin.asp)). On the other hand "teal, scarlet, indigo" would be marked wrong.

Reiterate what the correct answer or answers should be, and try to anticipate likely wrong answers so you can explain why they're not correct.
</div>
***

There are also questions that allow you to select from a drop down, but I don't know why that would be preferable over regular multiple choice. [Read more about quiz syntax here.](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md#quizzes)

Note that you can use any markdown formatting you want in quizzes, including bold, links, math, etc.

Surveys (ungraded questions)
---

You can ask questions with no graded answer as well. LiaScript calls these [surveys](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaScript/docs/master/README.md#111).

Here's an ungraded question with a text box three lines long:

[[___ ___ ___]]

Here's one that's just one line long:

[[___]]

Here's a multiple choice with no correct answer. What is your favorite Beatles album?

[(rev)] Revolver
[(wa)] The While Album
[(ar)] Abbey Road
[(sgtp)] Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

Here's a survey multiple choice that lets you select more than one response. Which Beatles albums do you love super hard?

[[rev]] Revolver
[[wa]] The While Album
[[ar]] Abbey Road
[[sgtp]] Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

Hints and follow-up explanations don't work for survey questions.


## Additional Resources

The last section of the module content should be a list of additional resources, both ours and outside sources, including links to other modules that build on this content or are otherwise related.

## Feedback

In the beginning, we stated some goals.
